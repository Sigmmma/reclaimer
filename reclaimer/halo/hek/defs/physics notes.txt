To calculate center of mass, add up all of the mass point position vectors multiplied by their relative mass, then divide the resulting vector by (total_relative_mass * number_of_mass_points).
This will give the center of mass as a vector.

xx, yy, and zz moments are affected by mass point radius
Remember that moments are the mass times the distance from the respective axis on a path perpendicular to the axis.
This will mean doing sqrt(y^2+z^2) for xx, sqrt(x^2+z^2) for yy, and sqrt(x^2+y^2) for zz
