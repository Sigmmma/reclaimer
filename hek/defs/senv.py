There are three self-illumination effects which are added together. 
Each effect has an <on color>, used when the shader is active, and an <off color>, used when 
the shader is not active. The self-illumination map is used as follows:
* RED: primary mask
* GREEN: secondary mask
* BLUE: plasma mask
* ALPHA: plasma animation reference

Each effect also has an animation <function>, <period> and <phase>, used when the shader is 
active. The primary and secondary effects simply modulate the <on color> by the animation 
value to produce an animation color, and then blend between the animation color and the 
<off color> based on the shader's activation level, and finally modulate by the mask.

The plasma shader compares the animation value with the alpha channel of the map (the plasma 
animation reference) and produces a high value when they are similar and a dark value when 
they are different. This value modulates the <plasma on color> to produce a plasma animation 
color, and the rest proceeds just like the primary and secondary effects."""
